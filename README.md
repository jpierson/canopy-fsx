canopy-fsx
==========

The script/fsx version of canopy. No need for Visual Studio.

1. I'm assuming you know how to use `fsi`.

2. Clone the repo.

3. If you're on Mac (assuming you've installed Mono MDK, F#), run:

    `fsharpi program.fsx`
    
4. If you're on Windows (assuming you have fsi.exe in your path). First rename `chromedriver.exe.windows` to `chromedriver.exe`, run:

    `fsi.exe program.fsx`
